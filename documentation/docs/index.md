**Build a consistent, themed UI in minutes.**

The Restyle library provides a type-enforced system for building UI components in React Native with TypeScript. It's a library for building UI libraries, with themability as the core focus.

This library assumes that the UI is built upon a design system that (at the very least) defines a set of colors and spacing constants that lays as a foundation. While the library acknowledges that there can be exceptions to the system by allowing any style to be overridden, it keeps the developer most productive when one-off values are kept to a minimum.

## Installation

Add the package to your project using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @shopify/restyle
```

Or npm:

```bash
npm install @shopify/restyle
```
